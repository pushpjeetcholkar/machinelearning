Here’s exactly what each parameter controls — and what it actually means in practice:

 1. n_samples=500

How many rows you want in your synthetic dataset.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 500 rows of data.
 If you're training anything more than a toy model, 500 is tiny — expect unstable results.

 2. n_features=10

Total number of input features (columns).
---------------------------------------------------------

 The function will generate 10 independent variables.
 Don’t assume all 10 matter — that’s what n_informative is for.

 3. n_informative=5

How many of those features actually affect the target variable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Only 5 features will be used to compute the real underlying linear relationship.
 The other 5 are pure noise/useless.
 This is how you test whether your model can identify signal vs junk.

If you set this wrong (e.g., too high relative to n_features), you're basically lying to yourself about how "realistic" your synthetic data is.

 4. noise=25.8

Standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to the target variable.

 Bigger noise means dirtier data.
---------------------------------------------
 25.8 is not small — your signal-to-noise ratio will drop hard.
 Expect weaker R² and more unstable coefficients.

If you're trying to teach regression basics, this is borderline too high unless you want students to struggle.



 5. random_state=0
s
Controls reproducibility.
--------------------------------
 Same seed → same data every run.
 Useful for teaching or debugging.
 If you leave it unset, every run produces different data, and your examples will become inconsistent.


This setup gives you:
==================
 500 samples
 10 total features
 Only 5 features actually influence the target
 A very noisy regression problem
 Reproducible output
